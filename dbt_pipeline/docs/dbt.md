You can change things between tables and views by changing a keyword rather than writing the data definition language (DDL) to do this behind the scenes.

## Materializations supported

dbt ships with five materializations:
- view
- table
- incremental
- ephemeral
- materialized_view.

Check out the [dbt documentation on materializations](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations) for more information on each of these options.

dbt also supports [creating your own custom materializations](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/create-new-materializations?step=1), if required, however this is an advanced feature of dbt.


## Model configurations supported

dbt allows us to configure:

`tags` to support easy categorization and graph selection
custom schemas to split your models across multiple schemas
aliases if your view/table name should differ FROM the filename
Snippets of SQL to run at the start or end of a model, known as hooks
Warehouse-specific configurations for performance (e.g. sort and dist keys on Redshift, partitions on BigQuery)

Check out the [dbt docs on model configurations](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/model-configs) to learn more.
